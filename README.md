Control DMX Led Par Lights with Arduino with Sound Level Detection

Control a series of LED par lights by DMX with an Arduino. Sound levels are measured by Adafruit Electret Microphone with AGC. 

Each LED Par uses 6 Channels but only the first 3 are for R, G, B. Other channels are for strobe functions we don't use.

- Fix ugly IF statements
- Easing!!
